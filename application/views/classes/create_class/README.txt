Dear ryan,

    I tried creating the template for this. We need to populate this data so that I
    can create the rest of the necessary CRUD files. I have some issues though, please think about them.

    1. CHeck the image for the classes as to the datatype. Does it work like the avatar in the sign up area? They have different data types
	2. responsive layout -> some labels and data overlaps the div on the on small screens. Check this one out
	3. Im gonna try to  create the same as this to the create course area. Im basing it to the database you created
