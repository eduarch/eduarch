Dear ryan,

    I tried creating the template for this. We need to populate this data so that I
    can create the rest of the necessary CRUD files. I have some issues though, please think about them.

    1. CHeck the image for the classes as to the datatype. Does it work like the avatar in the sign up area? They have different data types
	2. responsive layout -> some labels and data overlaps the div on the on small screens. Check this one out
	3. Im gonna try to  create the same as this to the create course area. Im basing it to the database you created
	4. Please check if I havent done any damage to accout setting and change info xD Cause I was basing everything there. I might have changed some few data over there.
	5. I didnt create a separate form.php for the create class kay gamay raman ang data needed.. Though Im a little wary with the courses or category. Id ont know how we should do it... Should we use tags? xD Hashtags?
	6. How do you merge ?? Im using Git Desktop for window and it's been a breeze. You really should reply to me and at least tell me what to do so that i know which area's to work on :)
	7. Tell me what you think about them okay?
	8. how to I access dashboard ? I want to help you out in that area. Tell me what I can do:) I cant rest well unless I know na daghan na ta nabuhat
